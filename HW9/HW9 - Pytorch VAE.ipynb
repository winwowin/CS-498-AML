    "An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. Variational autoencoder (VAE) models inherit the autoencoder architecture, but make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables. You can use this post as a reference.\n",
